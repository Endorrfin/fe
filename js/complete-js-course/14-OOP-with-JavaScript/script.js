/*
* 1. Abstraction
* 2. Encapsulation
*    Encapsulation: Keeping properties and methods private inside the class, so they are not accessible from
*  outside the class. Some methods can be exposed as a public interface (API)
* 3. Inheritance
* 4. Polymorphism
*    Polymorphism: A child class can overwrite a method it inherited from a paren class [it's more complex that that, but enough for our purposes].

/*
* CLASSICAL OOP: CLASSES
* Objects (instances) are instantiated from a class, which functions like a blueprint
*
* OOP IN JS: PROTOTYPES
* Objects are linked to a prototype object
* Prototypal inheritance: The prototype contains methods (behavior) that are accessible to all objects linked to
*  that prototype;
* Behavior is delegated to the linked prototype object
